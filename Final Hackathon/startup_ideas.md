## ✅ Input 1: Enter Feedback or Project Idea

We're building a mobile app for college students that automatically tracks assignments, deadlines, and exam dates by scanning their timetable or syllabus. It sends smart reminders and suggests study plans based on exam proximity. We'd like feedback on its usefulness and uniqueness.

## ✅ Input 2: 🔍 Paste Competitor App Reviews (optional for Review Agent)

App: MyStudyTracker

🌟 “Very helpful for keeping track of my assignments, but the reminder system is sometimes buggy.”
🌟 “I love how it syncs with my calendar, but it doesn't support PDFs from my university's portal.”
🌟 “Needs a better UI. It's a bit clunky and feels outdated.”

App: StudyMate

🌟 “A fantastic planner. The AI study suggestions are gold. Helped me focus before finals.”
🌟 “Wish it could scan syllabus PDFs directly. Manual entry is a pain.”
🌟 “Sometimes the study plan feels too generic and not tailored to my subjects.”
