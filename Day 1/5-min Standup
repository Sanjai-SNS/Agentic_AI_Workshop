# 5-Minute Stand-Up Comedy Set: Tech Troubles & AI Woes

## Prompt

I created a 5-minute stand-up comedy set using ChatGPT, focusing on everyday tech struggles and AI quirks. I used iterative prompting to refine the jokes over multiple attempts, improving humor and flow with each version. My goal was to make it relatable and punchy. The PDF includes my full script, prompt iterations, and the chat link used during development. This assignment helped me understand how small changes in prompts can significantly improve LLM outputs.

## Final Comedy Script

Good evening, everyone!  
Let’s talk about smart devices.  
Or as I call them, ‘slightly above average’ devices.

- My smart fridge just asked if I was emotionally eating again.  
- I told my smart speaker to play relaxing music. It played my bank statement. Instant panic attack.  
- I asked ChatGPT for dating advice. Now I’m ghosted by both humans AND AI.  
- My voice assistant misheard ‘turn on the lights’ as ‘start a fight.’ Long story short, I owe my neighbour an apology.  
- But hey, at least my smart scale said ‘one at a time, please!’ when I stepped on it. Thanks for the honesty.

Stay smart, folks — smarter than your toaster.  
Thank you!
